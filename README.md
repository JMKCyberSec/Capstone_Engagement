## Capstone_Engagement

### Red, Blue, and Monitoring Project

The purpose of this project is to utilze a prebuilt system to expose the user to all aspects of an attack. 
    - RED DAY - After ensuring that the ELK stack was engaged, the user then proceeds with a Red Team attack on the server. The activity will be logged on the ELK server for future analysis. This activity is also a great way to practice offensive strategies to penetrate vulnerable systems. 
    
    - BLUE DAY - This day is dedicated to using Kibana to research and pinpoint each breach in the red day attack. The ELK stack captured the traffic in logs which are analyzed and visualizations were created to show each of the attacks. 
    
    - REPORT DAY - The final day of this project is designed to allow the user to formalize the information gathered during this engagement into a presentable format. This report also allows the opportunity to present system hardening suggestions as seen in the report.
